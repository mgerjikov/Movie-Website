# Movie-Website

Create a Movie Website

Rubrics:

1. Page presents all required content (movie title, poster art, and trailer link).
2. Page is dynamically generated from a Python data structure.
3. Page is free of errors, glitches, and bugs.
4. Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers.
5. Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it.
6. Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is maintained throughout the program.
7. No variables override Python built-in values (for example, def).
8. Functions are used as tools to automate tasks which are likely to be repeated.
9. Functions produce the appropriate output (typically with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters).
10. No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function and variable definitions).
11. The appropriate data types are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate).
12. Student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, for element in list:; or to test whether something is in a list, if name in list_names:).
13. Code defines classes properly and uses instances of those classes in the code.
14. Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable).
